# DRM-ML-Project
This Repository contains the Juypter Notebooks and Spreadsheet developed for the article "Uncovering Structure-Activity Relationships for Ni-Catalyzed Dry Reforming of Methane via Interpretable Machine Learning"
# The main Juypter Notebooks used for machine learning models are "CatalysisML_Final_Syngas.ipynb" and "CatalysisML_Final_Conversion.ipynb".
These notebooks are used to generate the predictions and PDP plots
# The "CatalysisML_Trajectory.ipynb" Notebook contains codes to plot the trajectory plots
# Auxiliary notebooks are "CatalysisML_Final_DataAnalysis.ipynb" and "CatalysisML_Final_Apsenplt.ipynb"
They are used to generate other plots for data analysis and the surface plots from the Aspen Simulations
# SpreadSheets and CSV files
The spreadsheets for the Final Data are presents in both .xlsx and .csv formats
The "Simulation" spreadsheets contains results from Aspen Simulations.
The "trend.csv" file contains the number of past literature papers published on DRM
